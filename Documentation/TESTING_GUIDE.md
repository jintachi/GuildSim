## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue: "Character recruitment failed"**
**Cause**: Insufficient guild resources  
**Solution**: Check guild resource initialization in `GuildService`

### **Issue: "BalanceConfig not available"**
**Cause**: Configuration system not properly initialized  
**Solution**: Ensure `GameConfig.ensure_balance_config()` is called

### **Issue: "get_repository_name() must be implemented"**
**Cause**: Missing concrete repository implementation  
**Solution**: Implement `get_repository_name()` in repository classes

### **Issue: "Event not received"**
**Cause**: Event subscription or emission problem  
**Solution**: Check event types and subscription callbacks

### **Issue: "Save/Load failed"**
**Cause**: File system or serialization problem  
**Solution**: Check file permissions and data serialization

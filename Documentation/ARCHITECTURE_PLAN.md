# Architecture Plan - GuildSim Rebuild

## Original Problem Statement

The original ClaudeGuildIdlePrototype suffered from:
- **Monolithic Architecture**: All logic mixed together in single files
- **Tight Coupling**: Components directly dependent on each other
- **Poor Testability**: Difficult to test individual components
- **Maintenance Issues**: Changes in one area affected unrelated systems
- **Scalability Problems**: Adding new features required extensive refactoring

## Rebuild Strategy

### Core Architectural Principles

#### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Clear Domain Boundaries**: Characters, Quests, Guild, Resources
- **Pure Data Models**: No business logic in data classes
- **Domain Services**: Business logic separated from data access
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across codebase

#### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through events
- **Reactive Programming**: Systems respond to state changes
- **Event Sourcing**: Save/load based on event history
- **Typed Events**: Type-safe event definitions

#### 3. **Component-Based Systems**
- **Modular Design**: Reusable, independent components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies provided externally
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces

#### 4. **Performance-First Design**
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Optimized for game performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
- **Caching Strategies**: Reduce redundant calculations
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Architecture âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Establish core data models, events, and basic infrastructure

**Components Implemented**:
- **Data Models**: `Character`, `Quest`, `Guild`, `Resource`
- **Event System**: `BaseEvent`, typed event classes, `EventBus`
- **Repository Pattern**: `BaseRepository`, concrete repositories
- **Configuration System**: `GameConfig`, `BalanceConfig`
- **Save System**: Multi-slot save/load with auto-save

**Key Features**:
- Pure data models with no business logic
- Type-safe event system with proper inheritance
- Abstract repository pattern for data access
- Centralized configuration management
- Robust save/load system with error handling

### Phase 2: Service Layer âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Implement business logic services and dependency injection

**Components Implemented**:
- **Service Base**: `BaseService` with common functionality
- **Business Services**: `CharacterService`, `QuestService`, `GuildService`, `EquipmentService`, `TrainingService`
- **Service Manager**: Dependency injection and service coordination
- **Repository Integration**: Services use repositories for data access

**Key Features**:
- Clean separation of business logic from data access
- Dependency injection through ServiceManager
- Event-driven communication between services
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Configuration-driven business rules

### Phase 3: UI Layer ðŸš§ **NEXT**
**Goal**: Implement responsive, modular UI system

**Planned Components**:
- **UI Architecture**: MVVM pattern implementation
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive UI for different screen sizes
- **Component System**: Reusable UI components
- **State Management**: UI state synchronized with business logic
- **Theme System**: Centralized styling and theming

**Key Features**:
- Modern UI architecture with proper separation
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Reusable UI components
- Real-time state synchronization
- Consistent theming and styling

### Phase 4: Game Systems ðŸš§ **FUTURE**
**Goal**: Implement core game mechanics

**Planned Components**:
- **Quest System**: Quest generation, assignment, and completion
- **Character Management**: Recruitment, training, equipment
- **Guild Progression**: Leveling, upgrades, room unlocks
- **Resource Management**: Economy, trading, crafting
- **Time System**: Game time, scheduling, automation

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ðŸš§ **FUTURE**
**Goal**: Add advanced game features

**Planned Components**:
- **AI System**: Character AI, quest generation
- **Multiplayer**: Guild cooperation, competition
- **Modding Support**: Plugin system, custom content
- **Analytics**: Player behavior tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling, optimization

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. **Repository Pattern**
```gdscript
# Abstract data access
class_name BaseRepository
# Concrete implementations
class_name CharacterRepository extends BaseRepository
```

### 2. **Service Layer Pattern**
```gdscript
# Business logic services
class_name CharacterService extends BaseService
class_name QuestService extends BaseService
```

### 3. **Event-Driven Pattern**
```gdscript
# Typed events
class_name CharacterEvents
class_name QuestEvents
# Event bus
class_name EventBus
```

### 4. **Dependency Injection**
```gdscript
# Service manager handles dependencies
class_name ServiceManager
```

### 5. **Configuration Pattern**
```gdscript
# Centralized configuration
class_name GameConfig
class_name BalanceConfig
```

## Benefits of This Architecture
